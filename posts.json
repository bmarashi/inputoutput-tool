[{"title":"hello world - no bullshit short posts","content":"i'm experimenting with building a very simple twitter-esque tool for short posts and journaling.  it's been done a million times.  i don't want to build a social network from it.  i don't want to build a super blog tool.  i just want a no bullshit short post tool.  it's for me for now.  maybe i'll make different pages for different topics or reasons or uses in my life.  but ultimately, i want it to feel like basic and about the short but thoughtful writings.  no influence.  no ai.","date":"2025-06-13T18:31:42.262Z"},{"title":"lm-1 drum machine jam","content":"This morning I decided to go back to basics and work on a simple drum machine and synth jam using just my MPC Live II.  I own a lot of gear and I also make beats on my computer.  Either way, it's easy to start stacking and stacking more elements or processing or effects and get distracted from the real foundation of the music.  With that, I loaded up my favorite Linn LM-1 drum machine samples that I have loved for years.  I'm applying some light filtering and shelving of these samples as if I was running them through my DJ mixer.  So far, so good.  I've got a nice stripped beat going.  The next element I am working on is a lead synth sound that is similar to the lead synth sound in the Human Leaague's \"Don't You Want Me\".","date":"2025-06-13T18:36:37.647Z"}]
